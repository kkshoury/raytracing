# Simple Ray Tracer

This is my first attempt at writing a simple ray tracer inspired by "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"
The ray tracer can draw spheres with Matte, Metal, and Reflective materials.

Notice the shadows and reflections

Currently, the image is output as a PPM file. You can view it using File Viewer Lite or any other software that opens PPM image files.

I am working on adding bmp and jpeg support as well as more materials, effects, and code refactoring with time.
